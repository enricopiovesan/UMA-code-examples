# UMA Code Examples

This repository hosts code samples for the Universal Microservices Architecture (UMA). UMA is a design pattern for building portable microservices that can run across cloud, edge and client environments. Services built with UMA describe their own behaviour, requirements and runtime constraints through machineâ€‘readable metadata, enabling consistent execution across different platforms without rewriting core logic:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

These examples accompany the UMA book and illustrate the patterns and techniques described there. Each folder contains a complete example that you can build and run independently.

## Examples

| Example | Description | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Feature flag evaluator | A portable service that evaluates feature flags using a small rule engine and deterministic rollouts across browser, edge and server environments. | [`feature-flag-evaluator`](feature-flag-evaluator/) |

Additional examples will be added as the book evolves. Refer to the documentation in each folder for build and run instructions.
